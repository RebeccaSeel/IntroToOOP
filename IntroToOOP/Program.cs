            //To create new objects, create new classes (classes are like blueprints for what objects are going to be)
            //All objects from a class will have the same number and type of states, BUT...
            //each instance can have it's own unique values.

            //the format we use to instantiate an object look like this:
            //ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
            Cat mittens = new Cat(); //like what we did with Random which is an object
            //To create a new object, we use a special method called a CONSTRUCTOR

            //Thinking about objects in real life, create (either hand-write or type 3 examples of objects.
            //Your objects should have five states (characteristics) and five behaviors
